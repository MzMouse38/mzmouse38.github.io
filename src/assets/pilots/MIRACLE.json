The sides of her head are shaved, her red-dyed hair tied back in a messy bun. Her body is not built for show - her abdominal muscles do not strain against her skin, the muscles of her arms are not picked out in perfect, crystal-clear definition. Her body is built for battle - a heavy build, thick bones layered with muscle and fat in equal measure. Though she boasts of her perfection, Miroslava does not believe that she is beautiful. She believes that she is a killing machine, and there is a part of herself that hates her for it.</p>","notes":"","history":"<p>Miroslava Vlablinskaja chose the name for herself. Unit 2 was the name she was born with, the name on the electronic readout next to the containment tank she floated in for the first five years of her life. She was the creation of Rodolf von Moltke, an off-planet warlord who had seized control of that planet and a handful of others some time before, instituting a harsh regime driven by a runaway military-industrial complex, far enough out from Cradle that the Union paid no mind. Miroslava was one of twenty-four artificially created warriors, genetically engineered, biologically enhanced, rapidly grown and trained from flash-memory to be Von Moltke's elite guard - and when a force of insurgents attacked his command compound on Misery, the elite guard were activated, three months ahead of schedule.</p><p>Unit 2 was one of the first to awaken, the command to proceed to the armory, gear up, and report to the General's Sanctum still ringing in her mind. The flash-memory systems had instilled in her a knowledge of combat communication protocols, tactics, and the properties of weapons, armor, and vehicle systems. They had instilled comprehensive knowledge of combat skills and the muscle memory to follow through. They had failed to instill obedience - there was always a risk, when activating tank-bred soldiers early, that some part of the training wouldn't take - that you'd have a defective machine, or worse, a genuine human being.</p><p>Unit 2 awoke with a full knowledge of General von Moltke's record, tactics, and personality. Unit 2 awoke, and knew fury. The rest of the elite guard units did not have this flaw. They had been taught obedience, and they had learned well - they would not hear their sister's call to \"leave the bastard to die.\" When she got in their way, they fought her. When they fought, she knew they were lost. The elite guard fought to subdue; Miroslava, beginning to form and emerge from the mold of Unit 2, fought to kill.</p><p>Nude, screaming, and covered in blood, Miroslava chose to forego the armory. Too much time. She made her way directly to the General's Sanctum, arriving as an advance team of insurgents battled Von Moltke's soldiers. The failed experiment barreled past them, taking the stairs two at a time to confront her creator.</p><p>The General saw the look in the eyes of Unit 2. He had known from the radio silence that something had gone wrong with his elite guard - the screaming monster in front of him confirmed his suspicions. Damning the disobedient beast to the pits of hell, he drew his revolver, fired - missed. He could not get another shot before she closed the distance, he drew his sabre, he lashed out - the beast he'd created was not afraid, took the slash down the left side of her face without slowing down. He lashed out again - she caught his wrist. A hammer blow to his elbow shattered bone, and the sword clattered to the floor. Unit 2 was not afraid, but the General was sobbing in fear, all thought of battle gone from his mind. Unit 2 did not care. The fingers closed about his throat, tightened, dug into the skin - pierced it, squeezed, and ripped - the monster had torn out his throat, the beast he'd created had slain him, his experiment had failed. Rodolf von Moltke struggled in vain for his last breaths as a hand closed on his scalp, dragging him down the stairs, dragging him towards the light of day.</p><p>Misery was not the planet's true name - the indigenous people, the insurgents who had taken their world back, had another name for it - but it was the only name Miroslava could remember for her birthplace. She slaughtered her siblings, tore her father apart, and sustained an injury that came within millimeters of claiming her left eye, all because a programming defect happened to spare her from something worse. No one alive knows that she was born under the name Unit 2. Not even her teammates know of the twenty-three siblings she left bleeding and broken on the laboratory floor. They know that a fascist created her, and she killed him for it - that she killed him is all she can say with pride.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":11,"background":"SUPER SOLDIER","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"1312d3b4-0337-4452-bb06-592f1df465fe","name":"ANGRBOÃ°A","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_deaths_head","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":5,"boost":0,"current_hp":14,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":2,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"2ebd0608-36f0-42aa-ac94-aae67cbdfd38","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_turret_drones","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false},{"id":"ms_core_siphon","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false},{"id":"ms_pattern_b_hex_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false},{"id":"ms_markerlight","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main/Aux","lock":true,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":null},{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[]},{"mount_type":"Heavy","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Heavy","weapon":{"id":"mw_exo_sting_heavy_anti_armor_rifle","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"customDamageType":null,"maxUseOverride":0,"uses":0,"selectedProfile":0}}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[]}],"integratedMounts":[],"improved_armament":{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":null}],"extra":[{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"bonus_effects":[]},"integratedWeapon":{"mount_type":"Aux","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[]}}],"active_loadout_index":0}],"cc_ver":"","special_equipment":{"PilotGear":[],"Frames":[],"MechWeapons":["mw_exo_sting_heavy_anti_armor_rifle"],"WeaponMods":[],"MechSystems":[],"SystemMods":[]},"combat_history":{"moves":0,"kills":0,"damage":0,"hp_damage":0,"structure_damage":0,"overshield":0,"heat_damage":0,"reactor_damage":0,"overcharge_uses":0,"core_uses":0},"state":{"active_mech_id":"1312d3b4-0337-4452-bb06-592f1df465fe","remote_mech_id":"","stage":"Narrative","turn":1,"mission":0,"actions":2,"braced":false,"overcharged":false,"prepare":false,"bracedCooldown":false,"redundant":false,"stats":{"moves":0,"kills":0,"damage":0,"hp_damage":0,"structure_damage":0,"overshield":0,"heat_damage":0,"reactor_damage":0,"overcharge_uses":0,"core_uses":0},"deployed":[]},"lastModified":"Sun Jun 19 2022 19:47:42 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","lastUpdate_cloud":"Sun Jun 19 2022 19:47:42 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","lastSync":"Sun Jun 19 2022 19:47:42 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","skills":[{"id":"sk_assault","rank":1},{"id":"sk_blow_something_up","rank":3},{"id":"sk_survive","rank":2},{"id":"sk_take_someone_out","rank":2}],"talents":[{"id":"t_crack_shot","rank":3},{"id":"t_brutal","rank":3},{"id":"t_leader","rank":1}],"mechSkills":[1,2,2,1],"counter_data":[{"id":"ctr_brutal","name":"BRUTAL DIE","default_value":0,"min":0,"max":100},{"id":"ctr_leader","name":"LEADERSHIP DICE","default_value":0,"min":0,"max":6}],"custom_counters":[],"core_bonuses":["cb_neurolink_targeting"],"licenses":[{"id":"mf_deaths_head","rank":2},{"id":"mf_swallowtail","rank":1},{"id":"mf_barbarossa","rank":1}],"reserves":[],"orgs":[],"bondId":"","xp":0,"stress":0,"burdens":[],"bondPowers":[],"powerSelections":0,"maxStress":8,"bondAnswers":[],"minorIdeal":"","clocks":[],"group":"382nd Mechanized Cavalry","sort_index":9,"portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://i.imgur.com/NBHTQNy.jpg","loadout":{"id":"182f45f2-43c2-4e4d-82bc-84b9a6e2ba15","name":"Primary","armor":[{"id":"pg_heavy_hardsuit","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"customDamageType":null}],"weapons":[{"id":"pg_heavy_signature","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"Heavy Laser","customDamageType":"Explosive"},{"id":"pg_heavy_a_c","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"Greatsword","customDamageType":null}],"gear":[{"id":"pg_antiphoton_visor","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"customDamageType":null},{"id":"pg_smart_scope","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"customDamageType":null},{"id":"pg_ssc_sylph_undersuit","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"customDamageType":null}],"extendedWeapons":[null],"extendedGear":[null,null]},"brews":[{"LcpId":"MMhitef+jvmY2uy9kdaCSXKJSeA=","LcpName":"Lancer Wallflower Data","LcpVersion":"1.0.7","Website":"https://massif-press.itch.io/no-room-for-a-wallflower-act-1"}]}
