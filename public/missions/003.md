# Mission // #003
## Floodgate

Patience wants the squad to investigate the source of the signal and find out who is hĳacking the colony’s subalterns and drones. This mission rapidly changes from a simple investigation into a fighting retreat as the squad tries to staunch the flow of the Machine’s horde and fight their way back to Evergreen.

# Goals

- Fight back the Machine's horde.

# Stakes
- If the squad is unable to beat back the horde, it will grow stronger and there will be many civilian casualties as the militia struggle to cover evacuation efforts.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
