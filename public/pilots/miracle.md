A giant of a woman, Miroslava stands somewhat over seven feet tall, with a stern, blocky face marked by red brass piercings and a deep scar. The sides of her head are shaved, her red-dyed hair tied back in a messy bun. Her body is not built for show - her abdominal muscles do not strain against her skin, the muscles of her arms are not picked out in perfect, crystal-clear definition. Her body is built for battle - a heavy build, thick bones layered with muscle and fat in equal measure. Though she boasts of her perfection, Miroslava does not believe that she is beautiful. She believes that she is a killing machine, and there is a part of herself that hates her for it.
