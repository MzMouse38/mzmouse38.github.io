# MYCOL FIELDS // 12.25.3014
It has been three months since the destruction of Beggar One, Hivehome, and Evergreen. The unit formerly known as the MSMC 382nd Mech. Cav. has been working to help the relief effort non-stop. Mycol Fields remains the only surviving HUC city and the massive influx of refugees has taxed its infrastructure to the breaking point. The orbital bombardment and the resulting nuclear winter has left the continent in a deep, bitter chill that shows no sign of abating.

You wake from a nightmare. You are back in Patience’s casket chamber, their form intertwining with Beggar One’s as they both writhe in agony. As they scream, you wake, and for a brief moment you could swear a slender figure had been watching over you. When you turn on the light though, you realise it was nothing but an old coat rack.
Your data pad flashes for a moment as a message without a timestamp or sender pops up on screen. Written on the pad itself, perhaps?
 
“Wake up. Hivehome will need you. It’s going to be a long year. I’m sorry.”
